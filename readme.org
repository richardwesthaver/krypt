#+DESCRIPTION: Unix key management library
* Overview
The point of this library is to provide tools for /key management/
needs on Unix platforms. Our intent is to wrap well-built system
libraries such as Linux keyutils (keyctl) and provide simple safe APIs
for Common Lisp and Rust.

This library is opinionated about the algorithms it uses and is not a
general purpose tool.

* System Libraries
- keyutils ::
The library we are most keen on is [[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyutils.7.html][keyutils]] from the Linux Kernel
([[https://github.com/Distrotech/keyutils/blob/master/keyutils.h][git]]). It provides utilities for working with cryptographic keys and
uses syscalls to do the dirty work in kernel space. It has a simple
API and is supported on Linux/Darwin. The Rust bindings are on
[[https://crates.io/crates/linux-keyutils][crates.io]], no Common Lisp bindings (yet).
- secret-service ::
The [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/latest/][secret-service]] API is the brain-child of GNOME Keyring dev Stef
Walter and KWallet's Michael Leupold. User-space general-purpose
secrets management. Linux only.
- keychain ::
  [[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/][keychain-services]] serve a similar purpose to secret-service. It is
  MacOS only.
